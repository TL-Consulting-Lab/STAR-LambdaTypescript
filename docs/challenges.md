# Text Reverser API Challenges

This document outlines various challenges and exercises to help you learn and test the Text Reverser API functionality.

## Challenges

## Prompt 1: Create a Simple Frontend
```
Create a web page that:
- Has an input field for text
- Provides buttons for both GET and POST methods
- Shows the original and reversed text
- Handles errors gracefully
- Implements loading states
```

## Prompt 2: Add Language Detection via External API
```
Use an external API to detect the language of the input text before reversing it. Display the detected language along with the reversed text.
```
Or
```
“Call an external language detection API to get the language of input text and include it in the response.”
```

## Prompt 3: Test with Spanish Input
Try using "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" as input. Validate language detection, reversal, and stats.
```
“Write a test case for a Spanish input string to validate language detection and correct reversal.”
```

## Prompt 4: Write Unit Tests for Language Detection feature
```
Write unit tests to validate the language detection feature in the Text Reverser API. Include cases for
- Valid input
- Invalid input (e.g., empty string)
- Edge cases (e.g., special characters)
```

## Prompt 5: Add Performance Monitoring
```
Implement AWS CloudWatch metrics for:
- API response times
- Error rates
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Resource utilization
```

## Prompt 6: Explain the Code
```
Explain the Lambda code in high level.
```

## Prompt 7: Create a Workflow Diagram with Mermaid
```
Create a workflow diagram using Mermaid syntax to visualize the Text Reverser API flow from request to response.
```
